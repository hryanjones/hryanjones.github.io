Computer Module 2: Touch Typing
================

#. **Cursor** is the blinking line where text is inserted.
#. There are two methods of typing:
	* Hunt & Peck (*demonstrate*)
	* Touch Typing (*demonstrate*)
	
#. Hunt & Peck not effective because you:
	* Look at Keys
	* Only use 2 Fingers
	
#. Touch Typing is a valuable skill because:
	* You can go faster by using all fingers
	* You don't waste time looking at the keyboard
	
#. Proper Touch Typing Position:
	* Keyboard in a comfortable position (not stretching to reach, or "scrunched up")
	* Sitting up straight
	* Fingers laid lightly on the Home Row with thumbs on the Space Bar.
		* Home Row is the keys A-S-D-F on the left hand and J-K-L-; on the right.
		
	* Fingers should be slightly curled, so as to hit only one key
	
#. Typing tutor {KTouch, klavaro, gtypist, etc.}
#. Always look at monitor
#. Special Keys
	* *< Spacebar >* inserts a space
	* *< Backspace >* deletes one character to the left

#. Accuracy is more important than speed.
#. Holding down a key causes the letter (or space, or deletion) to repeat.
