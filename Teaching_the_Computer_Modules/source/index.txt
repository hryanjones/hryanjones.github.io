Welcome to Teaching the Computer Modules's documentation!
=========================================================

These notes on teaching computers to people with no computer experience came
out of my experience teaching computers in Uganda.  *These are not standalone!*
As a teacher they may provide a skeleton of where to start, but you should
throw in games (for learning how to use the mouse & keyboard) as well as any
other applications that your students will want to learn.  This guide is meant
to be fairly bare bones to get people using (and learning-by-using) computers
as soon as possible.  If you have any questions, comments, or requests about
this information please contact me through email (hryanjones@gmail.com).
Lastly, you can download an offline copy of these materials here:
