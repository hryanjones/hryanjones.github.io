Computer Module 1: Introduction and Using the Mouse
================

Introduction
------------
#. Some parts of the computer 
	* **Monitor (or screen)**: The "tv" or screen part, where we view our work and content. 
	* **Keyboard**: The grouping of buttons or keys where we can type words into the computer. 
	* **Mouse**: A device to graphically select and manipulate things on the computer. 
	* (**Advanced Parts**): see Appendix
	
#. Computer Lab Rules (*refer to chart*) 
	* No food or *drink* (*why? - because water can cause electronic devices to break*)
	 
#. Quickly introduce **Desktop** Space 
#. **Icons** - small pictures on Desktop 

Using the Mouse
---------------
#. Mouse is connected to the **pointer** (the small arrow on the screen). 
#. Move the pointer by moving the mouse on the desk [or one finger on the touchpad] 
#. Mouse has 2 buttons (one on left, one on right) 
#. Mouse Actions (*use GCompris games to give practice*)
	* **Point**: Move the pointer to an object. 
	* (Left-) **Click**: push the left mouse button once. 
	* **Double Click**: push the left button twice (fast). 
	* **Right Click**: push the right mouse button once. 
	* **Drag** (-and-Drop) : push and hold down the left mouse button, move the mouse on the desk to move the object to the desired location, then release the button. 

#. Only the very tip of the pointer matters when clicking. 
#. Common uses of Mouse Actions 
	* Point: View a short description of object 
	* Click: Select or Choose (especially on "buttons" or in menus) 
	* *Double Click: Open an icon (program) *
	* Right Click: Open an item's menu 
	* Drag: Move something

Appendix (more advanced information):
-------------------------------------

* computer: any electronic device that can carry out computations and stores data digitally (using a binary system - 1s and 0s). 
* hardware: the physical components (parts) of a computer. 
* software: the programs and operating system that are used by the hardware to do some work. 
* More parts of the computer [brackets indicate an optional device]: 

	* hard drive: The part of the computer that contains the operating system and stores information 
	* central processing unit (CPU): The part of the computer that performs actions such as calculations, comparisons, etc. (the part that "thinks") 
	* RAM (Random Access Memory): A resource of the computer that allows it to do more than one thing at once. A computer with more RAM memory can have more and larger programs open at the same time. 
	* motherboard 
	* video card
	* sound card 
	* ethernet card 
	* [CD-ROM drive (Compact Disc - Random Access Memory)] 
	* [DVD drive (Digital Video Disc)] 
	* [wireless card] 
	* USB ports: One of the most common types of ports on a computer that many devices (e.g. external Hard drive, external mouse, flash/pen-drive, camera) use to connect to the computer. USB stands for Universal Serial Bus.
