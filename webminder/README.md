# Webminder

This is a very simple HTML and JS file to create reminders that popup notifications.

It works best in Chrome (because Chrome has the best support for notifications features).

## TODO

1. use localstorage so existing reminders get persisted when the page isn't loaded
2. use a service worker for notifications, so notifications can happen even when the tab isn't open
3. Snooze and done actions
4. Better restatement (e.g. using relative time)
5. Sorting of existing reminders
